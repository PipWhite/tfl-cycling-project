# TFL(Transport for London) Cycling project

## Project Brief
This project was done as part of a business intelligence programming module while studying for my bachelors. The goal of this project was to use the publicly available TFL data to visually show a pattern using R. This would include using the libraries; readr, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, and stringr.
The tasks involved included; reading in csv files, understanding the files I would be working with, cleaning the data within the files, summarising the clean data, and finally using ggplot2 to visualise the data to show correlation.
